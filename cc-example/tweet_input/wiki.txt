== Sources do not support "Acupuncture is most commonly used for pain relief" ==

The lead says, "Acupuncture is most commonly used for pain relief", with two sources cited. The sources do not say the most common use of acupuncture is for pain relief. [[User:FloraWilde|FloraWilde]] ([[User talk:FloraWilde|talk]]) 12:15, 16 June 2015 (UTC)
:This one may go a bit beyond its sourcing: the two sources certainly say that acupuncture is commonly used for pain relief, but don't explicitly support the "most", even though that's likely to be a true statement. We could take the "most" out, or someone could find a source that explicitly states it.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 14:02, 16 June 2015 (UTC)
::"Go a bit beyond its sourcing" is WP:Weasel. The source does not support the statement. ''Most'' of acupuncture results from looking at a person's tongue in order to treat things ''other than'' pain. Under WP:UNDUE, this would preclude mention of treatment of pain before discussion of the vast majority of conditions it purports to treat. [[User:FloraWilde|FloraWilde]] ([[User talk:FloraWilde|talk]]) 15:22, 16 June 2015 (UTC)
::: Brings up a recurring discussion about whether this article is about the modality of acupuncture, which is practiced using varied theories/rationale, even by a single practitioner, or whether it is about TCM theory as reflected in acupuncture practice. The article is kind of a hybrid of the two approaches right now, which is fine. But kww's solution to take out "most" seems fine to me.

::::::Acupuncture is used to treat almost all disease. Picking out the most vaguely measurable things it claims to treat, e.g., psychological states such as pain, which on a tiny percentage of human illness conditions, then bringing that to the top of the lead, is WP:UNDUE. Under WP:MOS, a reader should be able to read the lead first paragraph and go away with an understanding of what acupuncture is. There is not a mention of how the tongue is used in diagnosis, nor any mention of the vast majority of human illness acupuncture is used to treat. That is a violation of MOS and UNDUE.

:::::::I share your pain, Flora, but that isn't a requirement of the first paragraph. Anyone that sticks to read the whole lead (four paragraphs), will see that acupuncture is generally ineffective for most things, and there's controversy over its effectiveness for pain and nausea. I've sought in vain for a reliable source that points out that the more subjective an illness is, the more likely it is that studies will find acupuncture is effective. If you can find one, bring it up, but with the sources we have, the lead is nearly as balanced as it can be.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 16:13, 16 June 2015 (UTC)

:I'm not particularly comfortable with the journal, but it isn't a surprising claim and doesn't need some kind of overwhelmingly reliable source.

Perhaps that would be better as the journal ([[Osteoarthritis and Cartilage]]) has an IF of 4.165, [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/osteoarthritis-and-cartilage] which is a lot higher than [[Complementary Therapies in Medicine]] (1.545).

== An officially "reasonable" option? ==

The United States [[National Institutes of Health]] says ''"acupuncture appears to be a reasonable option"''.[https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction#hed3] Here is some of the history[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_alternative_medicine#1990s_to_present]. Wikipedia has an article on [[reason]]. Please comment and contribute. [[User:FloraWilde|FloraWilde]] ([[User talk:FloraWilde|talk]]) 16:19, 26 June 2015 (UTC)

:Wikipedia has articles on many things. None of them are relevant to our article on acupuncture however, since we don't cite Wikipedia as a source. [[User:AndyTheGrump|AndyTheGrump]] ([[User talk:AndyTheGrump|talk]]) 16:27, 26 June 2015 (UTC)

:NIH uses the word "reason" in a way inconsistent with the Wiki article. What I am not understanding is use of the word "reasonable", in that each of the NIH "systematic reviews" showing some mysterious new "energy" source or proposed "biomechanism" for the "effects" (which TCM practitioners just happened to have come across by application of incorrect traditional Chinese anatomy, Chinese Astrology, and numerology, to start sticking needles in people to fight disease), notes that there was not a single truly double blinded study included in the systematic review, yet they went ahead and published the review as if there were such studies, and got the "efficacy" conclusion published in the abstract, without mention that the review included zero double blind studies, as if there were real double blinded studies being reviewed. [[User:FloraWilde|FloraWilde]] ([[User talk:FloraWilde|talk]]) 17:15, 26 June 2015 (UTC)

::The article says: "''Results from a number of studies suggest that acupuncture may help ease types of pain that are often chronic such as low-back pain, neck pain, and osteoarthritis/knee pain. It also may help reduce the frequency of tension headaches and prevent migraine headaches. Therefore, acupuncture appears to be a reasonable option for people with chronic pain to consider.''"

:::It seems to me that if the other organizations cited under [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture#Medical_organization_guidelines the Organization Guidelines] section are considered acceptable sources, than this one should be as well.

::This comes under the general controversy of whether it is ethical to prescribe placebos. If a patient believes acupuncture will help him, requests a referral from a doctor, and then receives acupuncture, it is actually quite likely that he will feel better, even if the result comes entirely from self-delusion.

:::Yes this makes sense to me Jayaguru. Regarding source quality, the NHS is different. MEDRS considers statements by bodies such as the NHS to be very high quality. What is actually considered unreliable are outdated statements and given that the Ernst statement is now 6 years old, it falls outside MEDDATE's window since some new (and wider) conditions have been favorably reviewed by Cochrane in that period of time and since the evidence overall has shifted in the positive direction. Not positive yet, but what I'm saying is that some reviews have stayed negative, some have gone from negative to null and some from null to positive.

The source is an information page, not a position statement, so it should only be used for uncontroversial information. Also, summarizing a list of six as "several" is not [[WP:SYNTH]]; you need two sources for synthesis to be possible. Either way, on second glance, specifying the exact number is probably better. 
::::::::{{u|Jayaguru-Shishya}}: Greetings. :-) I've made a different edit which removes one of the "conditions" much more easily: "other conditions" -> "others." How does that look? This maintains the version without the undue weight issue as well as the other changes for concision etc. (Please don't revert several changes if you're only providing objections to one of them. Was anything unclear from the edit summaries and/or do you have objections to the other parts? Also, either of the remaining "conditions" could be replaced by "uses," "circumstances," or a number of other terms if you prefer.) Keep in mind that the source is still being contested so it's not worth much to discuss the wording in detail yet.

::In my opinion, it would help if editors understood Wikipedia policies and guidelines better such as NPOV, MEDRS and BLP and we would see less edit warring all over the encyclopedia. I don't mind listing the relevant policy here if editors are confused or simply are unaware. Tags are necessary in some cases and our guidelines say that outdated sources need tags.

:::Your opinion is your opinion, [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]]. You do, however, ''know as certain fact'' that multiple other editors object to the tag, and, in fact, you are well aware that the material presented by the source ''has not changed in any significant fashion since its publication''.

::::Actually I know as a certain fact that only you and QuackGuru object to the reasonable tag. I see no other editors thus far who are willing to stick their neck out to combat guidelines and reasonable editing standards by objecting to a date tag for an outdated claim. But QuackGuru objects to anything that doesn't denigrate acupuncture, and I am surprised that you are objecting so strongly given the fact that you have an Arbcom case against you at the moment, part of which called into question your understanding of policies.

Interesting: the six conditions in that NHS source compared to the actual Cochrane reviews:
#Irritable Bowel syndrome: [http://www.cochrane.org/CD005111/IBD_acupuncture-for-irritable-bowel-syndrome Sham-controlled RCTs have found no benefits of acupuncture relative to a credible sham acupuncture control for IBS symptom severity or IBS-related quality of life. ]
#Migraine: [http://www.cochrane.org/CD001218/SYMPT_acupuncture-for-migraine-prophylaxis There is no evidence for an effect of 'true' acupuncture over sham interventions]
#Osteoarthrities: [http://www.cochrane.org/CD001977/MUSKEL_acupuncture-for-osteoarthritis benefits were small, did not meet pre-defined thresholds for clinical relevance, and were probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding]
Looks like someone has been doing some cherry-picking of the words from these reviews again.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 06:05, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
:Kww, I already pointed out on John's talk page that you trying to bust me as a cherry picker has been to pick the cherries first and claim I did it. Here's just one example, migraines, where you left out a slew of material: [http://www.cochrane.org/CD001218/SYMPT_acupuncture-for-migraine-prophylaxis In the previous version of this review, evidence in support of acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis was considered promising but insufficient. Now, with 12 additional trials, there is consistent evidence that acupuncture provides additional benefit to treatment of acute migraine attacks only or to routine care. There is no evidence for an effect of 'true' acupuncture over sham interventions, '''though this is difficult to interpret, as exact point location could be of limited importance'''. Available studies suggest that acupuncture is at least as effective as, or possibly more effective than, prophylactic drug treatment, and has fewer adverse effects. Acupuncture should be considered a treatment option for patients willing to undergo this treatment.] [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]] ([[User talk:LesVegas|talk]]) 17:40, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
::It's the NHS that cherry-picked, not you, [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]]. That's the problem with using a political body as a source in a scientific article.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 22:20, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
:::Well, I'm not opposed to quoting in more detail directly from Cochrane. If there is a way to summarize caveats in the lede to your liking, which I see is part of your objection, would you then compromise with me and delete the dated Ernst citation? In other words, we'll apply MEDDATE to Ernst and find something that gives greater parity to the NHS summary. I'll look and see if I can find something that works for you and get back to you, if you're on board with this. My purpose in making this change was to summarize the most recent evidence and if we need another source to summarize all the more recent evidence more fully, that's what we need to be doing anyway. And thank you for your explanation above, I appreciate it. [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]] ([[User talk:LesVegas|talk]]) 23:22, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
::::My first step is going to be to look up all 32 areas that Ernst reviews and doublecheck that there has been no shift in the results. If there has been no shift in the results, there's no reason to consider the source outdated. There's nothing about a statement that says "it isn't effective for a wide range of conditions"(Ernst) that actually contradicts "there's evidence of effectiveness for these other conditions" (NHS), which seems to be the root of your logic. The only reason to remove the Ernst citation would be if it truly ''is'' outdated: a source that found contradictory results to Ernst. The NHS source says what it says, and I am primarily concerned that it is a source that knowingly recommends placebo treatments. Review of the 32 conditions will take a few days.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 23:35, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
=== Lede has been updated ===

Current wording: "An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions, and they suggest it may be effective for only chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting, postoperative nausea/vomiting, and idiopathic headache.[12]"

Now that the lede has been updated we can delete the followed (including the tag): "[needs update] but there is some evidence that it may have a beneficial effect for six conditions,[13] and there are others where there is not enough high-quality evidence to draw any clear conclusions about efficacy.[13] Similar text [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acupuncture&diff=667132373&oldid=667130782 was deleted before].

:That was a clear-cut violation of your editing restrictions, which were to not make controversial edits. Since Cochrane reviews have now been updated to include more than just those few conditions, it is misleading to expand an outdated source like this, as I have pointed out. Anywho, I removed this expansion. [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]] ([[User talk:LesVegas|talk]]) 17:30, 7 July 2015 (UTC)

{{od}} Why was this source given additional weight[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acupuncture&type=revision&diff=670312013&oldid=670296818], even it's outdated per [[WP:MEDDATE]] and we already have a newer source? We should use the more recent source instead. Cheers! [[User:Jayaguru-Shishya|Jayaguru-Shishya]] ([[User talk:Jayaguru-Shishya|talk]]) 21:01, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
:Have you actually read both sources, [[User:Jayaguru-Shishya|Jayaguru-Shishya]]? Ernst evaluates 32 separate topics and finds that for 28 of them, there's no evidence of effectiveness. The "newer" NHS source does not provide any information that contradicts Ernst on 27 of those 28 conditions.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 22:18, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
::One of the points that I have been trying to make is that we have more conditions overall, now, with 7 conditions that have enough evidence to support effectiveness, compared with only 4 back in 2009. Additionally, the range has grown, with Cochrane reviews now showing evidence for other types of headaches, fibromyalgia, and even anti-psychotic effects. That's a wide range of conditions. Based on that, I don't know if Ernst would be able to publish the same statement in 2015 as he did in 2009, or if he would have to temper it some. There's been other changes too, with summaries of the evidence shifting from negative to null and two shifting from null to positive. I really have a larger point I'm trying to make other than the number of flipped studies, which, on their own should suffice to remove a quote that looks at broad data and makes a conclusion about it. When one of those pieces of underlying data change, a conclusion might also change. When several pieces of underlying data change, and the data set of conditions widens, and it's beyond MEDDATE's expiration date, what are we supposed to do? Wait until 10 conditions are positive? If 10 is too low then what about 15? 20? 28? Really, as editors we have to respect MEDDATE's 5 year window because otherwise there's no hard and set rules about when to discard a source and we'll have citations decaying and rotting all over the encyclopedia. [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]] ([[User talk:LesVegas|talk]]) 23:47, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
:::But you are trying to treat [[WP:MEDDATE]] as if it is some bright-line rule. It's not, as it includes such caveats as "While the most-recent reviews include later research results, do not automatically give more weight to the review that happens to have been published most recently, as this is recentism." What you need to find is a source that reviews similar things and makes a differing conclusion. Your NHS report is ''close'', but not really the same, as they did not report the items they evaluated and found negative results: they reported only positive and inconclusive results.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 00:07, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

::::If MEDDATE isn't a bright line rule whenever it's past 5 years and we have a change in the overall evidence compared to 2009, where do we stop? The World Health Organization conducted a review back in the early 2000's and found evidence for 40 conditions! Should we quote that? Absolutely not, for several reasons, one being that it's past the threshold and we have different studies sometimes showing more robust evidence for many of those conditions. This is why we have cutoffs on MEDRS once new evidence is reviewed. Anywho, I am glad that despite our differences in how we see this, you are at least open to compromising on this. [[User:LesVegas|LesVegas]] ([[User talk:LesVegas|talk]]) 00:26, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
:::::That study was widely denounced, so it wouldn't matter how recent it was. I wouldn't describe ''any'' of the evidence in favor of acupuncture as "robust".

:::: I think LesVegas is making a point here. We should use the most up-to-date sources that best reflect the current state of medical literature. Besides, we should be very careful not to be conducting a second peer-review of our own: "''Editors should not perform a detailed academic peer review.
